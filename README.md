# Wetteronline.de module

## What is it?

This module for Joomla! 5 displays the weather for a location, using www.wetteronline.de as a source.

## Usage

Just add the module to your site layout, and set the options as you wish.

### Options

These are the available options:

#### Module

The basic location settings.

* __Location__

  Set the location to display the weather for here (e.g. 'Berlin').

* __GID__

  This is a special ID from wetteronline.de. It controls where a click on the widget will lead the user. You have to find out the ID for your location yourself (go to wetteronline.de, display the weather for the desired location, and then try some of the pages until you find one that includes the GID in its URL).

#### Style

Settings that control what the embedded widget looks like.

* __Width__

  Choose from some preset widget widths.

* __Height__

  Choose from some preset widget heights. The height also controls which is being displayed in the widget.

* __Style__

  Enter any CSS style definitions here that will be applied to the `IFRAME` HTML element in which the widget will be displayed.

* __Display credits__

  This will display a little link to wetteronline.de below the widget. Be fair, leave this enabled.
